    Content is designed for personal development and relaxation, not diagnosis or treatment of mental health conditions. Individuals in crisis should contact licensed professionals, emergency services, or crisis lines. Resources are available at <a href="https://findahelpline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findahelpline.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>AI-Generated Content & User Conduct</h2>
  <p>
    Services may utilize AI technologies that occasionally produce incorrect, hallucinations, or offensive output.
